# Single-Level-Cache-Simulator
<p> A Single Level Cache Simulator implemented in C </p>

<p> This project models a single level cache and is implemented in C. Parts of the project are designed by CMPT 295 (Introduction to Computer Systems)
professor Arrvindh Shriraman as an assignment for this class, however I implemented most of the fucntionality. This project improved my coding skills in
C and helped me better understand how caches work. </p>
